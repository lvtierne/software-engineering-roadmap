# Machine Learning Model

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to solve a specific problem, such as classification or regression.

## Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning data.
- Training and evaluating a machine learning model.
- Making predictions based on new data.

## Steps
1. **Choose a Problem**: Select a problem to solve, such as image classification or text analysis.
2. **Obtain Data**: Gather and preprocess data relevant to the problem.
3. **Build the Model**: Choose and implement a machine learning algorithm (e.g., decision trees, neural networks).
4. **Evaluate and Tune**: Assess model performance and adjust parameters to improve accuracy.

## Example Code
### Python: Basic ML Model
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
```
