# Social Media Platform

## Objective
Develop a social media platform where users can create profiles, post updates, follow other users, and interact with posts.

## Features
- User profiles with personal information.
- Posting updates and media.
- Following and messaging other users.
- Feed of posts from followed users.

## Steps
1. **Choose a Technology Stack**: Use a technology stack such as MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) or Django + React.
2. **Design the Database**: Create a database schema for users, posts, and interactions.
3. **Build the Backend**: Implement API endpoints for user management and post interactions.
4. **Develop the Frontend**: Create a user interface with features like feeds, profiles, and notifications.

## Example Code
### MERN Stack: Basic Social Media Platform
```javascript
// Example of a MongoDB model for a user
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    password: String,
    posts: [String]
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
