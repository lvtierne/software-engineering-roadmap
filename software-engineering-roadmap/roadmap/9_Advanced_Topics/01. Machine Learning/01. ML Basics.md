# Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Training a model on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Classification**: Categorizing data into predefined classes.

## Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
