# Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers in a way that prevents any single entity from altering the record.

## Key Concepts
- **Blocks**: Containers for data.
- **Chain**: A series of blocks linked together.
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Protocols used to agree on the validity of transactions (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake).

## Use Cases
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin, Ethereum.
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.
