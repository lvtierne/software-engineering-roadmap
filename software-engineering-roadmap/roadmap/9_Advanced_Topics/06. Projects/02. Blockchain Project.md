## Project: Simple Decentralized Voting System

Develop a decentralized voting system using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Steps
1. **Setup Environment**: Install Ethereum development tools (e.g., Truffle, Ganache).
2. **Develop Smart Contract**: Write a smart contract to handle voting logic.
3. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy your contract to a test network.
4. **Build Interface**: Create a web interface for users to interact with the contract.

## Tools
- Solidity
- Truffle
- Web3.js
