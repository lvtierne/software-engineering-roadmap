# Machine Learning Project

## Project: Predict House Prices

Create a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.

## Steps
1. **Dataset**: Use a dataset containing house features and prices (e.g., Boston Housing Dataset).
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Model Building**: Implement a regression model to predict house prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared.

## Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## Example Datasets
- [Boston Housing Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing)

## Next Steps
- Enhance your model by experimenting with different algorithms.
- Visualize results to better understand model performance.
