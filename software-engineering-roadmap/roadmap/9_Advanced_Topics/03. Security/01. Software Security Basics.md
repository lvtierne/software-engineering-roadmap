# Software Security Basics

Software security involves protecting software applications from various threats and vulnerabilities to ensure their integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

## Key Concepts
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users.
- **Authorization**: Granting permissions based on user roles.
- **Encryption**: Protecting data by converting it into a secure format.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Writing code in a way that minimizes security risks.

## Common Threats
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Forging user requests.
