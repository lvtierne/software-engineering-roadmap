# Computers and How They Work

A computer is a machine that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions called a program.

## Components of a Computer
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain of the computer that executes instructions.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Stores data that is being used or processed.
- **Storage**: Where data is permanently stored (e.g., Hard Drive, SSD).
- **Input/Output Devices**: Devices like keyboards, mice, monitors, and printers that allow interaction with the computer.

## How Computers Process Data
- **Binary System**: Computers use binary (0s and 1s) to represent and process all types of data.
- **Operating System**: The software that manages computer hardware and software resources.
