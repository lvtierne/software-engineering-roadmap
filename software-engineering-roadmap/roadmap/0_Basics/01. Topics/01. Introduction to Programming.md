# Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions for computers to follow. It allows you to solve problems and create applications by writing code in various programming languages.

## Key Concepts
- **Syntax**: The rules that define the structure of a programming language.
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
- **Control Structures**: If-else statements, loops, etc., that control the flow of a program.
- **Functions**: Blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.
