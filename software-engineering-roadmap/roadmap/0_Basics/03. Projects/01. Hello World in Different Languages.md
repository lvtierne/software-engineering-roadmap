# Project: Hello World in Different Programming Languages

The "Hello World" program is the simplest program you can write in any programming language. It's a great way to start learning the syntax and structure of different languages.

## Objective
- Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" in at least three different programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, and Java).

## Steps
1. **Choose the Languages**: Decide which languages you want to try. If you're new, start with easy ones like Python and JavaScript.
2. **Write the Code**: Write a simple program in each language that outputs "Hello, World!".
3. **Run the Program**: Run the code in your local development environment to see the output.

## Example Code
### Python
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### JavaScript
```JavaScript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
### Java
```Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
## Reflection
- What did you learn from writing "Hello, World!" in different languages?
- How did the syntax and structure differ between languages?
## Next Steps
- Try writing a "Hello, World!" program in other languages like C++, Ruby, or Go.
