# Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development.

## Key Concepts
- **Repository**: A directory containing your project and its history.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in your repository.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository.
- **Push/Pull**: Sending and receiving changes between your local and remote repositories.

## Example Commands
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Add files to the staging area
git add <file>

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Check the status of your repository
git status

# Create a new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# Switch to a different branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Merge changes from another branch
git merge <branch-name>

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin <branch-name>

# Pull changes from a remote repository
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
