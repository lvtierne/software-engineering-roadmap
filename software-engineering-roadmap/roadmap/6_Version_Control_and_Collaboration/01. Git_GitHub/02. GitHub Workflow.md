# GitHub Workflow

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

## Key Concepts
- **Repository**: A Git repository hosted on GitHub.
- **Fork**: Creating a personal copy of someone elseâ€™s repository.
- **Pull Request**: Requesting to merge changes from one branch to another or from a fork into the main repository.
- **Issues**: Tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
- **Actions**: Automating workflows using GitHub Actions.

## Example Workflow
1. **Fork a Repository**: Create a copy of the repository to work on.
2. **Clone the Fork**: Download the fork to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Develop your features or fixes in a separate branch.
4. **Commit Changes**: Regularly commit your changes.
5. **Push Changes**: Upload your changes to GitHub.
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Request to merge your changes into the original repository.
7. **Review and Merge**: Review changes and merge them if they are approved.

## Example: Creating a Pull Request
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click on "New Pull Request".
4. Select the branch you want to merge and compare it with the base branch.
