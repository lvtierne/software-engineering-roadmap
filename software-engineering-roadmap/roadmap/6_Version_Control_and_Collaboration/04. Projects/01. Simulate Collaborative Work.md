# Project: Simulate Collaborative Work

Simulate a collaborative work environment using Git and GitHub.

## Objective
- Practice using Git and GitHub in a team setting.

## Steps
1. **Set Up Repositories**: Create a GitHub repository for your team project.
2. **Assign Roles**: Assign different roles (e.g., developer, reviewer) to team members.
3. **Collaborate on Code**: Each team member works on different features or bug fixes.
4. **Create Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for code review and merging.
5. **Review and Merge**: Review code from team members and merge changes.

## Example Project
- **Team Web App**: A web application where each team member is responsible for different features.
