# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Key Concepts
- **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created.
- **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the instance.

## Use Cases
- Managing a connection to a database.
- Implementing logging systems where a single instance is preferred.

## Example Code
### Python
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```
