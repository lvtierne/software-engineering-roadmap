# Project: Software Architecture Case Study

Study a real-world software architecture and analyze its design decisions and trade-offs.

## Objective
- Analyze an existing software system to understand its architecture.

## Steps
1. **Choose a Case Study**: Select a well-documented software system or project.
2. **Study Architecture**: Review the architectural decisions and patterns used in the system.
3. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Evaluate the pros and cons of the design choices.
4. **Present Findings**: Document your analysis and present your findings.

## Example Case Studies
- **Netflix Architecture**: Analyze how Netflix uses microservices and cloud services.
- **Google Search**: Study the architecture behind Googleâ€™s search engine.
