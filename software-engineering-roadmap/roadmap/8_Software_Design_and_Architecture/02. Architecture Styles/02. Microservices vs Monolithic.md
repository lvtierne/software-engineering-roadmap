# Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture

## Monolithic Architecture
- **Single Codebase**: The entire application is built as a single unit.
- **Tightly Coupled**: Components are interconnected and dependent on each other.
- **Deployment**: Easier to deploy but harder to scale and maintain.

## Microservices Architecture
- **Multiple Services**: The application is divided into small, independently deployable services.
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through APIs and are loosely coupled.
- **Deployment**: More complex to deploy but allows for better scalability and maintainability.

## Use Cases
- **Monolithic**: Suitable for small to medium-sized applications with fewer complexities.
- **Microservices**: Ideal for large-scale applications requiring high scalability and flexibility.

## Next Steps
- Evaluate your application's requirements to choose the right architecture.
- Experiment with building both monolithic and microservices-based applications.
