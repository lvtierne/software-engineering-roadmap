# Common Debugging Techniques

Debugging is essential for finding and fixing issues in your code. Here are some common techniques.

## Techniques
- **Print Statements**: Use print or logging statements to output variable values and program flow.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Isolate the problem by breaking down code into smaller parts.
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain your code and problem to someone else (or an inanimate object) to gain clarity.
- **Use Debugging Tools**: Leverage IDE tools like breakpoints and watch expressions for a more systematic approach.

## Example Technique: Print Statements
```python
def divide(x, y):
    print(f"Debug: x={x}, y={y}")
    return x / y
```
