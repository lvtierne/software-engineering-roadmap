# Debugging with IDE

IDEs come with built-in debugging tools to help you identify and fix issues in your code.

## Key Features
- **Breakpoints**: Pause code execution at specific lines to inspect variables and state.
- **Watch Expressions**: Monitor the values of variables and expressions.
- **Call Stack**: View the sequence of function calls leading to a specific point.
- **Step Execution**: Step through code line by line to observe behavior.

## Example: Debugging with Visual Studio Code
1. **Set Breakpoints**: Click on the left margin of the editor to set breakpoints.
2. **Start Debugging**: Press `F5` to start debugging.
3. **Inspect Variables**: Use the Debug pane to view variable values and call stack.
4. **Step Through Code**: Use the controls to step over, into, or out of functions.
