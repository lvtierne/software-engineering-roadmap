# Integration Testing Basics

Integration testing focuses on verifying that different parts of an application work together as expected.

## Key Concepts
- **Integration**: Combining different components or systems to ensure they work together.
- **Test Scenarios**: Real-world scenarios where multiple components interact.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the complete flow of an application from start to finish.

## Example Workflow
1. **Define Scenarios**: Identify scenarios where components interact.
2. **Prepare Test Data**: Set up data needed for integration tests.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute tests to validate interactions between components.
4. **Analyze Results**: Check if the integrated components work together as expected.

## Example Scenario
- **E-Commerce Application**: Testing the checkout process involving payment processing, order creation, and inventory updates.
