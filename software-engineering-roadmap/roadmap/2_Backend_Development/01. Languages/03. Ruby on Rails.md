# Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a framework for building web applications using Ruby. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Key Concepts
- **Models**: Represent data and business logic.
- **Views**: Define how data is presented.
- **Controllers**: Handle user requests and interact with models and views.
- **ActiveRecord**: ORM for database interactions.

## Example
```ruby
# Define a simple Rails model
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :content, presence: true
end
```
