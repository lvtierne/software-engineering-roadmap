# Project: Build a CRUD Application

Create a simple CRUD application to manage data using SQL or NoSQL databases.

## Objective
- Build a basic application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete records in a database.

## Steps
1. **Choose a Technology Stack**: Decide whether to use SQL or NoSQL, and select a programming language (e.g., Python, Node.js).
2. **Set Up the Database**: Create the database and tables/collections required for the application.
3. **Develop CRUD Operations**: Write code to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
4. **Build the User Interface**: Create a simple interface (CLI or web-based) to interact with the application.
5. **Test the Application**: Ensure that all CRUD operations work correctly.

## Example Project
- **Task Manager**: A web app to manage a list of tasks.
