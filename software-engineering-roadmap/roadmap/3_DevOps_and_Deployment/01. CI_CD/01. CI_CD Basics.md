# CI/CD Basics

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices aimed at improving the development and deployment processes.

## Key Concepts
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test code changes.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically deploy code changes to production.

## Benefits
- **Automated Testing**: Catch bugs early.
- **Faster Releases**: Deploy more frequently and reliably.
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Automate repetitive tasks.

## Example Tools
- **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows directly integrated with GitHub.
- **GitLab CI**: CI/CD integrated into GitLab.
