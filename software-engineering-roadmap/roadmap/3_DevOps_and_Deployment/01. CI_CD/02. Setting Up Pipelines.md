# Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines

Setting up CI/CD pipelines automates the build, test, and deployment process.

## Steps to Set Up a Pipeline
1. **Choose a CI/CD Tool**: Select a tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
2. **Define the Workflow**: Create a `.yml` or `.xml` file to define build and deployment steps.
3. **Configure the Pipeline**: Set up jobs for build, test, and deploy phases.
4. **Integrate with Code Repository**: Connect the pipeline to your version control system.
5. **Test the Pipeline**: Run the pipeline and ensure it performs the expected tasks.

## Example: GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Customize your pipeline configuration for specific needs.
2. Add more stages such as security scans or performance tests.
