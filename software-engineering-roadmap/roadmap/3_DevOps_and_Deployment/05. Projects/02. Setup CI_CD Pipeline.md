# Project: Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline

Create and configure a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a project.

## Objective
- Establish a CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development workflow.

## Steps
1. **Select a CI/CD Tool**: Choose a tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
2. **Create a Pipeline Configuration**: Define the build, test, and deploy steps in a configuration file.
3. **Integrate with Version Control**: Connect your repository to the CI/CD tool.
4. **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the pipeline and verify that it performs the expected tasks.

## Example
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Create a `.yml` file to define the workflow.
- **Jenkins Pipeline**: Set up a Jenkinsfile to define stages and steps.
