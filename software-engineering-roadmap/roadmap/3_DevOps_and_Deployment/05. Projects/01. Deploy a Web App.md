# Project: Deploy a Web Application

Deploy a web application to a cloud platform or server using Docker and CI/CD pipelines.

## Objective
- Deploy a web app using containerization and automation tools.

## Steps
1. **Choose a Web App**: Use an existing app or build a new one.
2. **Containerize the App**: Create a Dockerfile and build the Docker image.
3. **Set Up CI/CD**: Configure a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the containerized app to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
