# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant work.

## Key Concepts
- **Memoization**: Storing results of expensive function calls.
- **Tabulation**: Building a table to store intermediate results.

## Example: Python Fibonacci Sequence
```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
