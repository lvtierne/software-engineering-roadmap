# Arrays

An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key. Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store collections of data.

## Key Concepts
- **Definition**: An array stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
- **Indexing**: Access elements using their index (e.g., `arr[0]`).
- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.

## Operations
- **Access**: Retrieve elements by index.
- **Update**: Modify elements using their index.
- **Insert**: Add elements (requires shifting elements if array is full).
- **Delete**: Remove elements (requires shifting elements).

## Example (Python)
```python
# Define an array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Access an element
print(arr[2])  # Output: 3

# Update an element
arr[2] = 10
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]
```
