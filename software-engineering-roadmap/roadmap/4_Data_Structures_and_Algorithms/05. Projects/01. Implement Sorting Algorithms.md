# Project: Implement Sorting Algorithms

Implement and compare different sorting algorithms to understand their efficiency and behavior.

## Objective
- Implement several sorting algorithms and analyze their performance.

## Steps
1. **Select Algorithms**: Choose sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
2. **Implement Algorithms**: Write code for each algorithm.
3. **Compare Performance**: Test each algorithm with different data sets and analyze their time complexity.
4. **Document Findings**: Compare and document the efficiency and behavior of each algorithm.

## Example Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
